Define When as {Let P, Let A, If P then A else {}};

Define Range as
~~ Similar to python's xrange{} function
{
  Let A, Let B, Let S;
  List from
  {
    ~~ Nested helper function, invisible outside its scope
    ~~ Will stack overflow on large ranges due to lack of TCO
    Define Count as
    {
      Let X;
      When {X, <= B}
      {
        return X; 
        Count from + X S;
      };
    };
    Count from A;
  };
};

Print the Range from 0 to 10000 with step 2;
