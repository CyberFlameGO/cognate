Let (When P A) be (If P then A else ());

Let (the Range from A to B with step S) be
~~ Similar to python's xrange() function
(
  List from
  (
    ~~ Nested helper function, invisible outside its scope
    ~~ Will stack overflow on large ranges due to lack of TCO
    Let (Count from X) be
    (
      When (X, <= B)
      (
        return X; 
        Count from + X S;
      );
    );
    Count from A;
  );
);

Print the Range from 0 to 10000 with step 2;
