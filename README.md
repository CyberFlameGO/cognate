### The Cognate programming language.
Cognate is a stack oriented, functional programming language designed to help programmers specify their intent. Cognate uses optional syntax in order to help programmers write statements that are (mostly) readable in plain English and to include extra information about what statements are for, not just what they do and how they work. This leads to more maintainable codebases. Cognate's syntax is much simpler than other languages that aim for readability such as python, making the language consistent and simple to implement. This repository includes Cognac - the COGnate Naive Attempt at a Compiler.

As the above program shows, words starting with lowercase letters are ignored by the compiler (and greyed out). This allows comments and code to be easily bundled together, enhancing readability and allowing programmers to more easily express their intentions. While this means that Cognate can be very verbose, verbosity can be a good thing - this "informal syntax" gives extra information to anyone reading the source.
