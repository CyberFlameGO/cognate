### The Cognate programming language.
Cognate is a stack oriented programming language designed to help programmers specify their intent. Cognate uses optional syntax in order to help programmers write statements that are (mostly) readable in plain English and to include extra information about what statements are for, not just what they do and how they work. This leads to more maintainable codebases. Cognate's syntax is much simpler than other languages that aim for readability such as python, making the language consistent and simple to implement. This repository includes Cognac - the COGnate Naive Attempt at a Compiler.
